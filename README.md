# Pokedex

## What is this?

Tutorial using IPython Notebooks for data wrangling and analysis, leveraging a dataset about Pokemon.

## Where did the data come from?

The data referenced in the notebook is from https://github.com/veekun/pokedex as used on the website https://veekun.com/dex.

## Where can I see the notebook?

[Pokedex.ipynb](Pokedex Notebook)

The notebook is entirely re-producable.

## Why am I doing this?

Wanted to create a fun and relatable demonstration of using Notebook style analysis.

# TODO:
* Generate a `requirements.txt`
* Add a better narrative around the linear regression at the end of the notebook - possibly create an additional notebook.
* Bring in the Pokemon abilities as `list` into the dataset to demonstrate Pandas.DataFrames abilit to handle "complex" variable types.
