## What is this?

Tutorial using IPython Notebooks for data wrangling and analysis, leveraging a dataset about Pokemon.

## Where did the data come from?

The data referenced in the notebook is from https://github.com/veekun/pokedex as used on the website https://veekun.com/dex.

## Where can I see the notebook?

Launch a runnable instance of this notebook: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ryancollingwood/Pokedex/master?filepath=Pokedex.ipynb)

Otherwise [Pokedex Notebook](Pokedex.ipynb)

The notebook is entirely re-producable.

## Why am I doing this?

Wanted to create a fun and relatable demonstration of using Notebook style analysis.

# TODO:
* Bring in the Pokemon abilities as `list` into the dataset to demonstrate Pandas.DataFrames abilit to handle "complex" variable types.
* Do more Pokemon Data Analysis!
